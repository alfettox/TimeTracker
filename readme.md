- ‚è±Ô∏è **Start and Stop Timer:** Track time spent on each project by starting and stopping timers.
- **Elapsed Time Display:** View the elapsed time for each project in the format HH:MM:SS.
- **Add New Projects:** Easily add new projects directly from the app.
- **Reset for a New Week:** Start a new week and reset project times to zero, preserving historic data.
- **Display Database Data:** View project data in a tabular format.

## How to Use
1. Run `main.py` to start the app.
2. Select a project from the dropdown list.
3. Click the "Start" button to initiate the timer.
4. Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer.
5. The elapsed time for the selected project is displayed on the screen.
6. To add a new project, click the "Add Project" button, enter the project name, and click "Add."
7. To start a new week and reset project times, click the "Start New Week" button.
8. To view all project data in a table, click the "Display Database" button.
